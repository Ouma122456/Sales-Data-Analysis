## 🧮 Data Cleaning Notes
Before performing analysis:
1. Replace commas `,` with dots `.` in numeric columns.
2. Convert numeric columns (`Sales_USD`, `quantity`, `Price_USD`, `COGS_USD`) to float type.
3. Parse `Date_Time` into a proper date format.
4. Standardize separators in `Account_id` (e.g., replace `--` with `-`).
5. Optional: Round quantities to whole numbers if needed.
